    The first argument you give to the “chmod” command is ‘u’, ‘g’, ‘o’. We use:
    u for user
    g for group
    o for others,
    you can also use a combination of them (u,g,o).
    This specifies which of the three groups you want to modify.
    After this use
    a ‘+’ for adding
    a ‘-‘ for removing
    and a “=” for assigning a permission.
    Then specify the permission r,w or x you want to change.
    Here also you can use a combination of r,w,x.
    This specifies which of the three permissions “rwx” you want to modify
    use can use commas to modify more permissions
    Finally, the name of the file whose permission you are changing
